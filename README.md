# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built with React, created by **Muhammed Adan** to get familiar with React concepts. The app allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their to-do items. The to-do list is stored locally using the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Todo**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks from their list.
- **Local Storage**: The to-do list is stored in the browser's local storage, so it persists even after the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Local Storage**: For storing the to-do list data locally in the browser.
